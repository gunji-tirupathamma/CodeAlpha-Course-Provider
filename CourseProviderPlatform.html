                <p>Python full stack development refers to the use of Python programming language for developing both the front-end (client-side) and back-end (server-side) components of a web application. A full stack developer is capable of working with both the front-end and back-end technologies, as well as databases and other related tools to create end-to-end web applications.</p>
                <p>The skills required for Python full stack development typically include:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Python programming: Strong proficiency in Python, including understanding of core concepts such as data types, variables, control flow, functions, and object-oriented programming (OOP).</li>
